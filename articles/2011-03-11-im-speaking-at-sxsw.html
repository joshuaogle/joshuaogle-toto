    <a href="http://openbeta.extendedbeta.com" title="Open Beta 6">Open Beta</a> has graciously asked me to talk about the launch of <a href="http://keynot.es">Keynot.es</a>. Open Beta is a showcase of innovative ideas and technology companies from Oklahoma, and this year it's heading down to Austin as an official SXSW party.<br>

    This will actually be our third year to take part. At Open Beta 4, we were part of the <a href="http://startupweekend.com">Startup Weekend</a> competition that started the project. A few months later, at Open Beta 5, we let everyone in attendance into our "VIP Pass" private beta. In February we launched Keynot.es to the public and this time we're back to give everyone an update and share a few lessons we have learned along the way.<br>

    If you'll be in Austin on Monday, let us know <a href="http://twitter.com/keynotesapp">on Twitter</a>.
