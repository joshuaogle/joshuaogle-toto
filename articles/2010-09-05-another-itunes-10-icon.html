<p>Along with a large number of designers on <a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a> and across the internet, I've built my own replacement icon for iTunes 10. I think Apple really missed the mark by going a different direction than their other icons and the mobile side of the iTunes branding, along with a general lack of polish to the icon.</p>
<p>I've been using it for a couple of days now, and I love it. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/916710/site/iTunesX.zip">Here it is if you want to give it a try too.</a> Includes icons for Mac OSX and Windows, a PNG version and the original PSD for you to tweak if you want. Enjoy.</p>
