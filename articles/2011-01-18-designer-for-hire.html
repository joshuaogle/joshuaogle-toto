<p>Last year was an incredibly busy year for me. I started several long-term projects with <a href="http://brightb.it">Brightbit</a>, got a few personal projects off the ground and helped to push <a href="http://wimgo.com">wimgo</a> through huge milestones while being active in the local design and development community here in Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>This year is when many of those projects come to fruition, and I have had the opportunity to work with some great clients on exciting projects that I can't wait to share.</p>

<p>I have decided to work on freelance and contract work full time while I continue to work with Brightbit and build some ideas I've been working on for some time. Exciting things ahead. Make sure to follow me on <a href="http://dribbble.com/joshuaogle">Dribbble</a> and <a href="http://forrst.com/people/joshuaogle">Forrst</a> to see what I'm up to.</p>

<p>So if you are building a mobile or web app, or just need a designer to polish that brand or website, let's <a href="/contact">get in touch</a></p>
